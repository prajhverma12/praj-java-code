# Java and DSA Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to my Java and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice. It serves as a personal collection of code examples, exercises, and solutions to LeetCode problems.

## Purpose

* **Java Practice:** To practice and reinforce core Java programming concepts, specifically focusing on areas like Java Streams.
* **DSA Practice:** To implement and understand various data structures and algorithms.
* **LeetCode Tracking:** To keep a record of LeetCode problems I've solved, along with their solutions.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

* **`Java Streams/`:** Contains Java programs demonstrating the use of Java Streams API, including examples of filtering, mapping, reducing, and other stream operations.
* **`LeetCode/`:** Holds solutions to LeetCode problems, with each problem in its own file or directory.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/prajhverma12/praj-java-code.git](https://github.com/prajhverma12/praj-java-code.git)
    cd praj-java-code
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**

    * For Java Streams examples, go to `Java Streams/`.
    * For LeetCode solutions, go to `LeetCode/`.

3.  **Compile and Run Java Files:**

    * Use a Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run the Java files.
    * Example:

        ```bash
        javac YourFileName.java
        java YourFileName
        ```

## LeetCode Tracking

* Each LeetCode solution is typically stored in a file named `LeetCode[ProblemNumber].java` or within a directory that is named after the problem.
* Comments within the code provide context and explanations for the solution.
* I may also include notes about the problem's difficulty, time complexity, and space complexity.

## Contributing

As this is a personal practice repository, contributions are generally not expected. However, if you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Improvements

* Adding more detailed comments and explanations to the code.
* Expanding the `Java Streams` folder with more advanced examples.
* Improving the organization of LeetCode solutions.
* Adding unit tests for the code.
* Potentially adding other folders for different areas of Java or DSA practice.
